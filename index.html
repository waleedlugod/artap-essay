          Art is one of the most transgressive forms of media in society across
          history. Whether from literary classics, paintings from the
          Renaissance, or animated TV shows, everyone has seen and been
          influenced by art in some form. As a computer science student, I am no
          exception to this. For example, a popular career choice for computer
          science students to go into is web development, and to me, the most
          pertinent form of art in my life is websites. More specifically, art
          is present in my daily life through the user interface, user
          experience, and the code of websites.

          The user interface of websites is the most obvious and recognizable
          form of art on websites. What the user interface pertains to has a
          pretty wide scope, but a few things of note would be a visual
          hierarchy and text. To elaborate, the visual hierarchy relates to the
          different orders of emphasis on elements. For example, it is not
          unreasonable to want users of your website to notice certain elements,
          such as the title or navigation bar. By increasing the
          <span class="font-size">font size</span> and changing the
          <span class="background-color">background color</span> respectively,
          these elements are emphasized, thus creating a certain order that the
          eyes want to follow. Text, on the other hand, is self-explanatory, and
          refers to the specific text of the site such as the
          <span class="font-size">font size</span>,
          <span class="font-type">font type</span>, line height, and
          <span class="letter-spacing">letter spacing</span>. Each of these
          different attributes contributes to a “feel” of the final text. For
          example, a
          <span class="tanker">big and bold sans-serif font</span> can feel like
          a punch to the face, while a
          <span class="boska">small-serif font</span> can feel more formal. It
          is important to note that these elements are not mutually exclusive,
          but rather build upon each other to contribute to the final website.
          Overall, a good user interface is what the artist views will make the
          final product both enjoyable and easy for people to use.

          But what about behind the curtains? Is there any artistic quality in
          the <span class="mono">code written</span> for the website? Although
          it may not be evident at first, it's fair to regard it as art. Rarely
          is it sufficient to have the code work alone. Instead, good code is
          readable, maintainable, and performant. To elaborate, readable code is
          written so that its purpose is easily discernible which can be done
          through good naming conventions and proper spacing. Similar to how the
          user interface is designed for the ease of users, readable and
          maintainable code is designed for the ease of the developers.
          Performant code can be considered art as well as it requires a clever
          insight into the problem, and some nuance to form a working solution.
          However, the most difficult part is to make code performant as well as
          readable, and maintainable at the same time. It is not uncommon to
          sacrifice one for the other but to make a program that encapsulates
          all these attributes is a skill in itself, one which I consider an
          art.
        </p>

          As you can see, art is a dominant force in my life, one that I
          interact with daily. As a computer science student, web development is
          not something I am unfamiliar with, and to create a good website
          requires a special kind of artistic ingenuity. Firstly, the website
          itself should look appealing and be easy to use which can be done
          through various sizes, colors, and spacing of elements. It is also
          important to make the back-end, namely the code, readable,
          maintainable, and performant as well. If the website needs to be
          updated, code that has these qualities will make the lives of the
          programmers that much easier. Finally, a website that is both well
          designed on the front-end and back-end will create an experience that
          will form a lasting impression.
